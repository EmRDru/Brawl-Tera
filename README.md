# Welcome to Brawl Tera! 
### by EmRD

> Main version of Brawl Tera - v1.0

Soon **`Brawl Tera`** may cease to exist altogether, it’s already a matter of time. Although this is my very first project, I will replace it with another, more colorful one.

**Instructions:**
1. Download Brawl Tera (it doesn’t matter in .exe or .py, the presence of a Python compiler (3.5 and higher) decides here)
2. Open the program and watch how your trophies grow

This project can be considered as a simulator for watching how to collect trophies like in the game [**Brawl Stars**](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/). There are no bugs here, but there will definitely be fixes!

**Pros of the project:**

- Two game files, for those who have a python compiler and for those who do not
- The program was completed in half an hour and no bugs were found during the playtest

**Disadvantages of the project:**

- Quick addition of trophies due to which it is not clear how much the player received
- There are no fixed ranks
